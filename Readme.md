# 🧾 Login System Mini Project
Overview

This is a simple command-line login system built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
The program allows users to:

Set a username and password (both must include at least one number).

Log in using their credentials.

Change their password while enforcing the number rule.

Receive clear error messages for incorrect credentials.

This mini project demonstrates basic OOP, loops, conditionals, and input validation in Python.

Features

✅ User account creation with username & password.

✅ Username and password must include at least one number.

✅ Login verification with detailed feedback:

Incorrect username

Incorrect password

Both incorrect

✅ Password update functionality with validation.

✅ Continuous menu until successful login or exit.

Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Methods)

Loops and Conditional Statements

Input Validation

How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

Clone or download the repository.

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

Run the program:

python login_system.py


Follow the on-screen instructions:

Set a username (must include a number).

Set a password (must include a number).

Use the menu to log in or change the password.

Example Workflow
Set your username: user123
Set your password: pass456

--- Menu ---
1. Login
2. Change Password
-🧾 You can Login Now🧾

Enter an option: 1
Enter your username please: user123
Enter your password please: pass456
🎉 Login successful!

Future Improvements

Masking password input using getpass so password is not visible.

Store multiple user accounts in a dictionary or file.

Add a retry limit to prevent brute-force attempts.

Implement password strength requirements (uppercase, lowercase, symbols).
